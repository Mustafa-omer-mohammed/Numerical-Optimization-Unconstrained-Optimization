The function definition is in .It is trivial that minimal solution for this function is x = (1, 1) and the Actual minimum is 0.
In our problem we had two initial points we will refer to as :x01 [âˆ’1.2, 1]T and x02 [1.2, 1.2]T . First of all, it is crucial to understand the best as possible the behaviour 
of f(x) in 2-D.
