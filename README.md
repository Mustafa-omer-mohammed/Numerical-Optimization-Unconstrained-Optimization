# Numerical-Optimization-Unconstrained-Optimization
In  this project , we conduct a detailed analysis on the characteristics of some of the numerical optimization methods tested to the three problems from **[Test Problems for Unconstrained Optimization](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325314497_Test_Problems_for_Unconstrained_Optimization)**. More specifically, we compared the Steepest Decent, Newton Method and Inexact Newton Method applied to Problem 1 [Chained Rosenbrock function ] , Problem 25 [Extended Rosenbrock function] , Problem 76 and problem 81. We tested the first problem in 2- D space and the remaining three problems in N-D space, where N = [103,104,105]. For each problem we calculated analytically the gradient and the hessian in order to apply the chosen methods. We optimize successfully each function with at least one method.
